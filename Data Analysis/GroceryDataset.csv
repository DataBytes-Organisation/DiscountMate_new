Drink the first one when you wake up in the morning, and try to drink the last one two hours before sleeping. Add one Wellness shot and one Vitality shot at any point of the day to boost your cleanse. Juice cleansing is intended to replace solid meals, though again everyone is different and should consume food, water and juice as they need. Be prepared for changes in your digestion and even sleep rhythms as your body adjusts to the cleanse, and make sure you stay hydrated with water throughout, as you might find shifting energy levels and mood in your first juice cleanse.

Pressed is on a mission to make high nutrition a realistic option for all. Our cold-pressed juices are made with all-natural fruits and vegetables - no added sugars.   How to cleanse: Although everyone is different and needs to listen to their body as they cleanse, Pressed’s juice plan recommends drinking one 12oz juice every 2 hours in the following order: Greens with Ginger, Orange Turmeric, Roots with Ginger, Greens with Ginger, Sweet Citrus, Avocado Greens Smoothies. Drink the first one when you wake up in the morning and try to drink the last one two hours before sleeping. Add one Wellness shot and one Vitality shot at any point of the day to boost your cleanse. Juice cleansing is intended to replace solid meals, though again everyone is different and should consume food, water and juice as they need. Be prepared for changes in your digestion and even sleep rhythms as your body adjusts to the cleanse, and make sure you stay hydrated with water throughout, as you might find shifting energy levels and mood in your first juice cleanse.

Our green juice is perfectly blended, so you never have to compromise taste for nutrition.   Orange Turmeric - Orange Turmeric is a blend of orange, apple aloe vera, turmeric, lemon, and black pepper. Our Orange Turmeric elevates everyday OJ with a vibrant blend of orange juice, black pepper, and turmeric from Fiji.   Roots with Ginger - We've blended ginger and beets to create delicious juices for all taste buds-from earthy to sweet! Grown deep in the ground, root vegetables absorb high amounts of vitamins and minerals from the soil. They have distinct, earthy flavors and are packed with fiber and complex carbohydrates.   Sweet Citrus - Our citrus blend is refreshing, hydrating and crisp. It contains ingredients like lemon and mint that provide a pick-me-up when you're feeling down.   Avocado Greens Smoothie - Expertly blended and ready to go, this clean and simple recipe is packed with power greens like spinach, kale, and spirulina, mixed with banana, avocado, and matcha for a creamy-smooth taste.   Wellness Shots - These shots are lemony with a powerful kick from ginger and cayenne.   Vitality Shots - These shots are milder than the wellness shots, sweet and spicy with an earthy aftertaste.

NuTrail Keto Nut Granola – Honey Nut offers keto and low carb dieters a delicious keto breakfast. An all-natural medley of pecans, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, coconut, almonds, butter, and monk fruit sweetener will have your taste buds in heaven. To stay low carb, we recommend pairing our granola with unsweetened almond milk or plain greek yogurt. NuTrail is committed to making high quality, low carb foods.   How is our granola so sweet and still low carb?
Simple. We leverage the sweetness of an amazing sugar alternative: monk fruit sweetener. That, combined with the healthy fats from our blend of nuts creates the crunch sweet sensation that will sure to become a staple in any pantry.   I'm not on Keto, can I still enjoy this?
Absolutely! Many of our customers enjoy our granola during, and after they're done with the keto diet. It really is that good.   2-pack (22 oz each)
Delicious, low carb keto breakfast with only 3g Net Carbs!
The crunchiness you've been missing in your keto lifestyle.
A delicious blend of pecans, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, coconut chips, almonds, butter, and monk fruit sweetener

INFORMATIVE VIDEOS help users get started quickly and demonstrate the key features that set Twist and Shout Mop apart.Have you tried traditional mops, spray mops or steam mops and gotten frustrated by how ineffective or overpriced they are? While the traditional mops are affordable, they do not clean well and are difficult to wring. Other mops seem to have you hooked on endless expenditures of proprietary pads and solution refills. And few of the mops can reach the dusty areas under furniture and tight corners.​Twist and Shout Mop is the original self-wringing mop that rotates at up to 2500 rpm. By gently pushing down the aluminum alloy handle, the mop spins dry automatically without touching. Unlike other spin mops, Twist and Shout Mop does NOT have the easily breakable foot petal. Its innovative design has won the gold medals of 2011 iENA International Innovation Award and 2011 INST International Invention Show.The super absorbent mop head is made of over 8,000 strands of microfiber that lock in dust, spills, and stains instead of pushing them around. Microfiber can absorb up to 8X their weight in liquid and cleans 3X better than cotton.The specially designed swivel joint allows the mop head to bend 180 degrees and easily clean the hardest reachable areas under furniture and around tight corners.And the best part of it all? This is a product that is designed for sustainability. It doesn’t require expensive disposable pad refills, special cleaning solutions, batteries, or power. You can clean with just water or any cleaning solution that is safe for your family and pets. Each microfiber mop head lasts up to a year and costs little to replace, minimizing your total cost of ownership compared to other cleaning systems in the market.Be Sure To View The Official Product Demo and Comparison Video Before Purchase"

In 1964, Tim opened a coffee and donut shop in his neighborhood, setting out to create a place where anyone could go at any time and feel at home. A place where the door was always open for neighbors to pop by, where there was always a pot of coffee on (a fresh pot every 20 minutes to be exact). That single coffee shop became such a favorite that more locations soon began to open in neighborhoods across Canada, then the US, and now parts all over the world.   Tim Hortons Original hasn't changed in over 50 years, and is such a secret that only 3 people (and we're not telling who!) know the recipe.

Spain is the second most mountainous European country after Switzerland, and so Serrano Ham is produced all over the country.When we talk about Serrano ham we do not refer to the general denomination of “cured ham from pigs raised in mountain areas” but, specifically, to a special ham category: which is one that comes from the white pig. The white pig is the result of the crossbreeding of Landrace, Duroc-Jersey, Large White and Blanco Belga, among others. These white pigs are fed with natural fodders, composed of cereals. Their young are controlled until the moment of the animal sacrifice, at the age of about 6 or 7 months, with an approximated weight of 95 to 100 kg.Spain has been producing cured hams for many centuries. Ham is a rooted product in the Spanish history and it can be considered as an essential factor of its culture.The Serrano Ham is produced according to traditional methods that award it a sweet and slightly aromatic palate. Its flavor and its sensory characteristics make it a gastronomic product of its highest quality, guaranteed by a traditional process and a good selection of raw material.Ingredients:Pork ham, sea salt.Storage Conditions:May be refrigerated. Store in a cool and dry place.Consumption:Ham should always be eaten at room temperature (57ºF at 71ºF).After carving, lay the slices on a wooden board and allow them to breathe for at least thirty minutes. This intensifies the flavour for a truly authentic taste. In Spain, Serrano Ham is usually eaten as a ""Tapa"". That is to say, as an aperitif, in small and very thin slices and perhaps accompanied with bread and a red glass of wine or a beer. But Serrano Ham, due to its excellent quality and gastronomically qualities, has inspired renowned chefs around the world to prepare all kinds of recipes (from the simplest to the most sophisticated)."

1 ½ lbs (2 - 12 oz packs) heritage applewood smoked bacon
(1) 8 oz tub of black truffle butter
Japanese Wagyu & Black Angus Breed
Ships uncooked and frozen UPS 2nd day   Are you ready for the ultimate burger experience? Imagine a American Wagyu burger on an artisanal brioche burger bun, topped with heritage-breed applewood-smoked bacon and crowned with creamy black truffle butter.   Every element of this burger is special, beginning with the beef: D’Artagnan American Wagyu beef comes from Wagyu cattle, the same breed that produces the famous Kobe beef of Japan. When raised in the United States, these cattle produce equally tender beef, but are referred to as “American Kobe-style” or simply “Wagyu.” The texture of this incredible beef carries a softness that defies description, along with that world-renowned buttery Kobe flavor.   American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from pure Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from the small percentage of Certified Black Angus in the herd. It’s the best of both worlds, united in one tenderloin.   Just like the burgers, the bacon has impeccable credentials: heritage-breed hogs known for great taste and creamy fat are raised naturally on small family farms. The pork bellies are smoked over real applewood, and are cured without additives or nitrites. This slightly sweet bacon is the perfect topping for the burgers.   That would be enough for most, but to take this burger to the extreme, add D’Artagnan’s rich black truffle butter, with its pungent aroma, distinct flavor and aura of luxury for the ultimate burger topping.   What can you put these mega-burger ingredients on? Nothing but the best, artisanally-baked brioche buns will do. Not your standard burger bun, these buttery and springy brioche buns work perfectly with the other elements to create the ultimate fantasy burger. Your mouth will thank you.   Cooking tips:   Cook burger patties from frozen state to keep from overcooking them
Cook to Desired doneness. We suggest cooking to an internal temperature of 160°f.
Slowly toast buns that have been smothered in truffle butter
Prepare bacon on grill over medium heat prior to cooking burgers, careful of flare-ups
Top off cooked burger with a large dollop of truffle butter"

Never-ever program - no hormones or antibiotics ever
Ships frozen   Ribeyes, Filet mignon's from beef tenderloin, and burgers… oh my! D’Artagnan’s Ultimate Steak Lovers Gift Box is here to satisfy all the carnivores in your life!   American Wagyu Filet Mignon Steaks, 2 Steaks, 6 ounces each. American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from a small percentage of Certified Black Angus. It’s the best of both worlds, united in one steak.   American Wagyu Beef Patties, 2 Patties, 8 ounces each. Like the Wagyu beef filets, our burgers come from humanely raised cattle on small family ranches in the west. The Wagyu cattle live on pasture, never receive antibiotics or hormones and are finished in the traditional Japanese way: with incremental amounts of grain that encourage their natural propensity to exquisite and abundant marbling. 75% Lean, 25% Fat   USDA Choice Bone-In Ribeye Steaks, 2 Steaks, 20 -22 ounces each. These Choice-grade Angus steaks are wet-aged for 21 days to add complexity to the flavor. D’Artagnan’s group of dedicated ranchers raise Angus cattle on open pastureland, without antibiotics, hormones or any other artificial substances. All you get is clean beefy flavor – as it should be.   As if 3 amazing varieties of fantastic beef weren’t enough, this gift box also comes with gourmet accompaniments to help create the perfect steak dinner!   Black Truffle Butter is a silky creamery butter blended with real black truffles which adds a robust and earthy flavor to elevate steaks to the next level!   Veal Demi-Glace is made from a traditional recipe using veal bones, aromatic vegetables, water, wine and nothing else, and is slow-cooked for many hours, creating concentrated flavor and silky smooth texture. The perfect base for any sauce.   Dried Wild Mushroom Mix is packed with flavor and once reconstituted, makes a great topping on the steaks and burgers.   Whether a steak-searing pro or recipe-reading novice, this gift is perfect for lovers of all things beef and includes helpful tips and recipe ideas to keep the meals coming (hopefully back your way)!   Cooking tips:   Cook burger patties from frozen state to help ensure to prevent overcooking them
Filet mignon steaks & burgers are recommended cooked rare to medium-rare
Season steaks simply with salt, pepper and olive oil and allow the extraordinary flavor to shine
Make a quick and easy pan sauce by adding the veal demi-glace in with the pan drippings once steaks are cooked. Scrape up any browned bits remaining in the pan while demi-glace is reducing. Cook until sauce is a syrupy consistency; stir in some truffle butter to finish. Season with salt and pepper if needed."

Because of the frequency with which we bake, Ferrara acquired our great reputation for quality and freshness. Today, Ferrara is still a family-owned business operated by the fifth generation. That’s perhaps the most wonderful thing about Ferrara. Since its beginning in 1892, the spirit, recipes and devotion to quality has changed very little.Includes:2 lb Assorted Italian Cookie Tray16 oz.

Plug-in device   How it Works:   Zevo Flying Insect Trapuses light to continuously attract flying insects (house flies, fruit flies and gnats) and capture them on to an adhesive backing that you never have to touch.   Designed for any room or area in your home where you see flying insects.   Replace refill cartridge when it's full of insects. Check it every 15 days or as needed.   FOR BEST RESULTS:   DO place in electrical outlets that are easily accessible and near common areas.   DO use in an indoor electrical outlet where flying insects enter into the home such as garages and enclosed porches/patios (near entryways), and where they tend to gather, such as in kitchens, near fruits and vegetables,
trash cans, houseplants, drains, etc.   DO try other locations and electrical outlets if ZEVO is not attracting flying insects.   DON'T obstruct the trap or place behind doors, furniture, computers, TV's, etc.   Keep Zevo plugged in 24/7"

Comparisons to other meat sources have shown that bison meat has a greater concentration of iron, zinc and essential fatty acids.
Bison meat is a rich source of complete protein containing all the essential amino acids in appropriate amounts. Each serving contains about 22 grams of protein which is then used in the body to build and repair tissues, produce enzymes and some hormones, and maintain cell membranes and components of the immune system.
Rich in Vitamin B12, Selenium, Zinc and Phosphorus, bison meat is also an excellent source of Iron, Vitamin B6 and Niacin, all of which are recommended daily.
Bison meat contains the ""essential fatty acids"", linoleic (omega - 3) and linoleic (omega - 6) fatty acids. These substances are necessary for us to eat but can not be made in our bodies and are thus, commonly lacking. Their function is to assist the formation of cell membranes, aiding in the production of hormone-like compounds, and participating in immune and visual processes.

If you are among its many fans, you’ll rediscover its charms with D’Artagnan Certified-Humane Green Circle™ Chicken breast. This chicken is exclusively and humanely raised for D’Artagnan on small farms in the Amish community in free-range conditions without the use of any antibiotics or hormones. Old-fashioned methods are used to create a truly modern – and richly flavored – chicken. D’Artagnan’s Green Circle chicken program brings back the methods of family farms from over a century ago, when chickens lived on vegetable scraps and roamed freely around farmyards and pastureland. Inspired by that common-sense, waste-nothing philosophy, the chickens are raised on a diet of locally collected vegetables and trimmings. No growth hormones, tranquilizers, arsenicals or antibiotics are ever used. The chicken is also air-chilled during processing, which is vastly different from the industry standard in the U.S. where chickens are immersed in vats of cold water - which causes the chicken to absorb water and dilute the flavor, while also severely increasing the risk of cross-contamination. Air-chilled chicken is cooled by passing the birds through several chambers where cold, purified air is used to cool the meat - resulting in no added moisture, stronger flavor and less chance for contamination. The natural juices are not diluted, so the meat is more tender and flavorful. When you buy water-chilled chicken, you are paying for water—on average 8% of its body weight. But with air-chilling, all you pay for is chicken.Certified-humane chicken - No antibiotics or hormones addedRaised on small farms; diet is supplemented with locally collected vegetable scrapsAir-chilled for maximum flavor concentration24 breasts (2 breasts per pack; 12 packs per kit)12 packs, 11 lbs total minimum weightShips uncooked & frozen"

Flash freezing halts the natural deterioration of the flesh, and locks in freshness.

Average Per Whole Chicken   Heritage Breed Chicken   Raised to 85 Days   Free Range Chickens   Product of USA","Rediscover the joys of chicken with D’Artagnan Green Circle™ certified-humane heritage chicken. Roast a whole chicken for Sunday dinner, smoke chicken in the backyard, or braise in a slow cooker until fall-apart tender. Save the bones to make your own stock and enjoy homemade soup.   These heritage-breed chickens are exclusively raised for D’Artagnan on small farms in the Amish community, in free-range conditions without the use of any antibiotics or hormones - for twice the time of an average chicken. Old-fashioned methods are used to create a truly modern – and richly flavored – chicken.   D’Artagnan’s Green Circle chicken program brings back the methods of family farms from over a century ago, when chickens lived on vegetable scraps and roamed freely around farmyards and pastureland. Inspired by that common-sense, waste-nothing philosophy, the chickens are raised on a diet of locally collected vegetables and trimmings. No growth hormones, tranquilizers, arsenicals or antibiotics are ever used.   The chicken is also air-chilled during processing, which is vastly different from the industry standard in the U.S. where chickens are immersed in vats of cold water - which causes the chicken to absorb water and dilute the flavor, while also severely increasing the risk of cross-contamination.   Air-chilled chicken is cooled by passing the birds through several chambers where cold, purified air is used to cool the meat - resulting in no added moisture, stronger flavor and less chance for contamination. The natural juices are not diluted, so the meat is more tender and flavorful. When you buy water-chilled chicken, you are paying for water—on average 8% of its body weight. But with air-chilling, all you pay for is chicken.   Features:   3.25 lb avgwhole chickens

Japanese Wagyu & Black Angus Breed
Ships uncooked and frozen UPS 2nd day   Are you ready for the ultimate burger experience? Imagine a American Wagyu burger on an artisanal brioche burger bun, topped with heritage-breed applewood-smoked bacon and crowned with creamy black truffle butter.   Every element of this burger is special, beginning with the beef: D’Artagnan American Wagyu beef comes from Wagyu cattle, the same breed that produces the famous Kobe beef of Japan. When raised in the United States, these cattle produce equally tender beef, but are referred to as “American Kobe-style” or simply “Wagyu.” The texture of this incredible beef carries a softness that defies description, along with that world-renowned buttery Kobe flavor.   American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from pure Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from the small percentage of Certified Black Angus in the herd. It’s the best of both worlds, united in one tenderloin.   Just like the burgers, the bacon has impeccable credentials: heritage-breed hogs known for great taste and creamy fat are raised naturally on small family farms. The pork bellies are smoked over real applewood, and are cured without additives or nitrites. This slightly sweet bacon is the perfect topping for the burgers.   That would be enough for most, but to take this burger to the extreme, add D’Artagnan’s rich black truffle butter, with its pungent aroma, distinct flavor and aura of luxury for the ultimate burger topping.   What can you put these mega-burger ingredients on? Nothing but the best, artisanally-baked brioche buns will do. Not your standard burger bun, these buttery and springy brioche buns work perfectly with the other elements to create the ultimate fantasy burger. Your mouth will thank you.   Cooking tips:   Cook burger patties from frozen state to keep from overcooking them
Cook to Desired doneness. We suggest cooking to an internal temperature of 160°f.

This impressive gourmet beef package includes cowboy ribeye steaks and Domestic American Wagyu burgers. Included are eight bone-in ribeye steaks, each weighing an impressive 20 -22 ounces. These Choice-grade steaks are wet-aged for twenty-one days to add complexity to the flavor. Each steak is individually packaged so you can save a few for later, or plan a party and use them all at once. D’Artagnan steaks come from a group of dedicated ranchers who raise their Angus cattle on pastureland, with lots of room to roam. The cattle are never administered antibiotics, hormones or any other artificial substances, and grow at a slow and natural pace. So you get nothing but clean beefy flavor – just the way it should be. Rounding out this ultimate beef package are twelve 8 ounce Kobe-style beef patties. You’ll be cooking like a star chef with these juicy burgers. The texture of this incredible beef carries a softness that defies description, along with that world-renowned buttery Kobe flavor. The burgers are individually sealed and packaged in twos, so you can store them in the freezer and enjoy luxurious burgers anytime you like. D’Artagnan Domestic American Wagyu beef comes from Wagyu cattle, the same breed that produces the famous Kobe beef of Japan. When raised in the United States, these cattle produce equally tender beef, but are referred to as “ American Kobe-style” or simply “Wagyu.” Raised humanely without antibiotics or hormones, on pasture and finished in the traditional fashion: with incremental amounts of grain that build on the breed’s natural propensity to exquisite and abundant marbling, American Wagyu beef is a tasty treasure. With all these steaks and burgers, it could just be the perfect gift for that person on your list or choose to just enjoy them yourself!Cooking tips: Cook burger patties from frozen state to help ensure to not overcook themBurgers are suggested rare to medium rareSeason steaks simply with salt, pepper and olive oil and allow the extraordinary flavor to shine.

Line a baking sheet with foil.Pat the salmon dry with a paper towel.Drizzle some oil over the top of each filet— just enough to coat the salmon — and rub it over the salmon with your fingers or a pastry brush. Sprinkle the salmon generously with salt and pepper.Place the salmon in the roasting pan, skin-side down. Transfer to the oven.Roasting time depends on the thickness, as determined by the thickest part of the salmon filet. For every half-inch of salmon, roast 4 to 6 minutes - 4 minutes will give you salmon that is still a touch rare, 6 minutes will thoroughly cook it.You can also check the doneness of your salmon with a fork. When the salmon flakes easily with a fork, it's ready. If you like, you can use an instant read thermometer to check the fish for doneness. Recommended minimum internal temperature is 145°F, which should be measured at the thickest part of the portion.Serve immediately: Enjoy your salmon immediately. Leftovers will keep refrigerated for about 5 days, and can be gently reheated in the microwave"

Total   6 Total Bags   Ships Frozen,"Enjoy homemade poke bowls with this sushi-grade yellowfin tuna, pre-chopped for convenience. Responsibly caught in the wild by longlines, this premium tuna fish is dolphin-safe and the perfect choice for your poke party.
Poke, which rhymes with okay, is a famous raw fish salad from Hawaii that has been gaining fans around the world. This quick and easy one-bowl meal is made with flexible ingredients so that each bowl can be tailored to individual tastes. Raw tuna is the crowning glory of any poke bowl, and only the best quality will do, just as with sashimi.
Begin your poke bowl with warm rice - brown, white, wild, or short-grain - and add layers of raw vegetables including chopped sweet onion. Make it your own with cucumber, edamame, daikon, or shredded carrot. The cubed tuna should be dressed and briefly marinated with soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and a little honey. For those that like it hot, add sriracha or red pepper. Slices of creamy avocado make a great addition, along with seaweed salad, or crumbled nori.
Make poke keto or paleo-friendly by replacing the rice with riced cauliflower, or skipping it altogether and adding more vegetables. Raw and refreshing, this tropical treat is hyper-healthy and allows you to play with color, texture, and flavors each time you create a bowl.
Poke is an outside-the-box solution for summer gatherings or quick family meals. You will be well prepared for quick and easy meals with this ready-to-eat chopped tuna.
Not ready to go raw? Quickly pan-sear the cubed tuna and serve over rice, noodles, or stir-fried vegetables. Elevate a tuna wrap with seasoned and lightly seared yellowfin cubes instead of the canned stuff. Any salad will be transformed by seared tuna cubes - even a classic Nicoise salad with green beans, potatoes, and hard-boiled eggs.
To thaw: Place frozen poke cubes in the refrigerator the night before you plan to prepare your meal. Once thawed, open the package and pair it with your favorite accompaniments.   Pack size: 1lb of cubed Yellowfin Tuna

Bavette Steaks   2 Packs of 1 12 Oz. NY Strip Steak,"D’Artagnan’s ABF Butcher Box Collection provides ample opportunities to make restaurant-quality steak dinners at home. With three different types of steak included, you’ll expand your repertoire at the grill or in the kitchen.
This impressive gourmet package includes single-portion bavette, hanger, and NY strip steaks. Each steak is individually butchered, trimmed, and vacuum-sealed for your convenience. Keep them in the freezer until the mood strikes or a party gathers.   Bavette steak - also known as sirloin flap - is a cult favorite with butchers and chefs and is often hard to find in grocery stores. This well-marbled steak is similar to flank and skirt cuts, although much beefier and more supple than either. Try marinating bavette steak and then searing or grilling it. Be sure to slice it against the grain to best enjoy the texture and rich flavor.
Hanger steak is nicknamed butcher’s steak because this especially tender and flavorful cut was so often held back to feed the butcher’s family. The cut is from the short plate under the ribs - a muscle that does little work, so it has a lush texture. Whether you are an accomplished chef or a beginner, pan-searing and grilling hanger steak over high heat is easy, and rewards with a flavor similar to ribeye.
NY strip steak is among the most popular cuts of beef and comes from the short loin. With its tender texture, the strip steak is a favorite of steakhouses and countless backyard grillers. Enjoy strip steak with eggs for a hearty breakfast, crusted with pepper and pan-seared, or seasoned simply and grilled to rare or medium rare.   D’Artagnan beef comes from a group of dedicated ranchers who raise their Angus breed cattle on pastureland, with lots of room to roam. The cattle are never administered antibiotics, hormones, or any other artificial substances. They grow slowly and naturally, so the cattle take a little longer to come to market, but that’s fine with us. A stress-free lifestyle produces tasty results. So you get nothing but clean beefy flavor – just the way it should be.   Features:   Angus-breed cattle

Filet mignon steaks & burgers are recommended cooked rare to medium-rare
Season steaks simply with salt, pepper and olive oil and allow the extraordinary flavor to shine
Make a quick and easy pan sauce by adding the veal demi-glace in with the pan drippings once steaks are cooked. Scrape up any browned bits remaining in the pan while demi-glace is reducing. Cook until sauce is a syrupy consistency; stir in some truffle butter to finish. Season with salt and pepper if needed."

Each bite of our Authentic Wagyu Filet Mignons will provide a complex beef flavor that you will remember long after you have cleaned your plate. Each bite you will experience an unbelievably tender, intense flavor and mellifluous, “melt-in-your-mouth” texture. Authentic Wagyu's Japanese A5 is imported from Kagoshima, Japan which is located in the far south of Japan. The Kagoshima prefecture is collectively responsible for around 20% of Japan's Kuroge Wagyu cattle, the Wagyu breed that produces Japanese A5 Wagyu. Kagoshima's consistent temperate climate and ecology are well-suited for raising healthy cattle with low stress levels, a necessary component of achieving A5 quality. Kagoshima Wagyu took the top prize at ""The Wagyu Olympics"" this year based on overall contest scores. You could say that Kagoshima's A5 Wagyu is the best beef in Japan right now!If you have never tasted A5 Fullblood Authentic Wagyu, the experience can be next to impossible to describe. The one description beef connoisseurs the world over can agree upon is your opinion as to what a steak should taste like, will be changed forever. With phrases such as, “melts in your mouth”, “beef perfected” and “unlike any other steak I have ever tasted before”.A5 Fullblood Wagyu beef is truly in a league of its own. The legendary, sometimes mythical process of Authentic Wagyu cattle raising in Japan has been handed down through the generations, all in an effort to protect their national treasure. Wagyu (WA meaning Japanese and GYU meaning cow) Beef. Intensely satisfying in small portions, one must taste this beef to really speak to the mouthwatering, buttery flavor with extreme tenderness and smooth texture.The A5 Wagyu steaks secured for our Costco members are the most rare and single most prized beef steaks found globally. In 2016, only 200 metric tons are imported duty free into the United States. With a much smaller percentage of that total weight graded in Japan as A5 quality. The Japanese beef grading scale is quite different than the USDA scale of Select, Choice and Prime. In Japan, there are 12 different categories of beef quality. With the “A5” selection being the best of the very best.Authentic Wagyu in partnership with Costco, has secured this exquisitely distinct beef utilizing their direct relationships with the farmers of Japan, their genetics and mythical process of cattle raising that has been passed down from multiple generations.

This unique characteristic is the fruit of GOLDEN NEST®, commitment to have all swallow nests be 100% hand-washed and 100% bleaching-free.   The 100% hand-washed method is still the time-tested premier method to minimize the impurities content in the nest. This method, however, is losing its popularity due to significant product loss during the cleaning process. Also, some minor impurities might still remain visible, due to the absence of bleaching agents to ‘cover’ them (read: ‘Why Bleaching’ at the back page). However, GOLDEN NEST® believes that the best swallow nest should always be completely natural; to achieve a 100% natural final product, 100% hand-washed raw swallow is the unwavering, ultimate standard.   Finally, the absence of bleaching agents, along with advanced cooking technology similar to those used in preservatives-free commercial baby food technology, makes this product safe for elderly people, nursing/ pregnant women, and even babies that are ready for solid food. Enjoy!   Made in USA."

A single cell of honeycomb is filled with the concentrated nectar of thousands of flowers. Honey Comb is the purest, rawest honey available. You cannot get more “raw” and “100 Pure” than honey comb. It’s the ultimate raw honey. Because the honey is still in the comb and has not been touched by humans, it contains pollen, enzymes, propolis, vitamins, amino acids, antioxidants, minerals, and aromatics that the bees produced in the hive. The wax that makes up honeycomb contains very-long-chain fatty acids, along with long-chain alcohols, or esters. The honey stored within the honeycomb is the purest, rawest form of honey, and the wax the honeycomb is made of has nutritional value and health benefits. We cut our comb from the frame by hand and pack it for your enjoyment with no additional treatment or processing.   We carefully select and hand cut each square then pack them in a clear, resealable, plastic container.

Magnatum Pico connects with roots of poplar, willow, hazel, oak and hazel trees and the time of its harvest is very short – from September till January.   Its skin (peridium) is smooth and ochre yellow or olive yellow in colour, and sometimes it can reveal a more rustic cracked area or light red spots. The gleba (fleshy inner mass) is firm in structure, at the beginning whitish and then pale yellow, ochre brown, reddish brown, streaked with many thin white lines.   Intensive in scent and strong but pleasant in flavor.   For best storing: wrap each truffle singularly in paper towel, place them inside a glass jar, and store in your fridge. Replace the paper towel daily.   Remember: Truffles do not like humidity!   Truffle is underground tuberous fungus, considered to be the height of gastronomy.

If you are among its many fans, you’ll rediscover its charms with D’Artagnan Certified-Humane Green Circle™ Chicken breast. This chicken is exclusively and humanely raised for D’Artagnan on small farms in the Amish community in free-range conditions without the use of any antibiotics or hormones. Old-fashioned methods are used to create a truly modern – and richly flavored – chicken. D’Artagnan’s Green Circle chicken program brings back the methods of family farms from over a century ago, when chickens lived on vegetable scraps and roamed freely around farmyards and pastureland. Inspired by that common-sense, waste-nothing philosophy, the chickens are raised on a diet of locally collected vegetables and trimmings. No growth hormones, tranquilizers, arsenicals or antibiotics are ever used. The chicken is also air-chilled during processing, which is vastly different from the industry standard in the U.S. where chickens are immersed in vats of cold water - which causes the chicken to absorb water and dilute the flavor, while also severely increasing the risk of cross-contamination. Air-chilled chicken is cooled by passing the birds through several chambers where cold, purified air is used to cool the meat - resulting in no added moisture, stronger flavor and less chance for contamination. The natural juices are not diluted, so the meat is more tender and flavorful. When you buy water-chilled chicken, you are paying for water—on average 8% of its body weight. But with air-chilling, all you pay for is chicken.Certified-humane chicken - No antibiotics or hormones addedRaised on small farms; diet is supplemented with locally collected vegetable scrapsAir-chilled for maximum flavor concentration24 breasts (2 breasts per pack; 12 packs per kit)12 packs, 11 lbs total minimum weightShips uncooked & frozen"

How To Cook Salmon in the OvenIngredients:2 – 3 lb skin-on salmon filetOlive oilSaltPepperLemon wedges, to serveInstructions:Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack placed in the middle. Line a baking sheet with foil.Pat the salmon dry with a paper towel.Drizzle some oil over the top of each filet— just enough to coat the salmon — and rub it over the salmon with your fingers or a pastry brush. Sprinkle the salmon generously with salt and pepper.Place the salmon in the roasting pan, skin-side down. Transfer to the oven.Roasting time depends on the thickness, as determined by the thickest part of the salmon filet. For every half-inch of salmon, roast 4 to 6 minutes - 4 minutes will give you salmon that is still a touch rare, 6 minutes will thoroughly cook it.You can also check the doneness of your salmon with a fork. When the salmon flakes easily with a fork, it's ready. If you like, you can use an instant read thermometer to check the fish for doneness. Recommended minimum internal temperature is 145°F, which should be measured at the thickest part of the portion.Serve immediately: Enjoy your salmon immediately. Leftovers will keep refrigerated for about 5 days, and can be gently reheated in the microwave"

When we first started making Bites, this was the first flavor our chef came up with. It seemed a little odd as a first flavor choice, but once we tasted it we gave him a high five. There is just something special about this buttery mixture of coconuts and cashew along with our signature chewy-crispy texture. This is that secret snack you don't want to tell people about cause they'll buy it all and then there won't be any for you.   Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter
This is one of those snacks where you take a bite and then you kinda pull back and look at the snack with a quizzical expression, and then you look at the package, and you think ""there's no way this is healthy"" and kinda shake your head a little when you see that it is indeed healthy and has a lot of protein and is vegan and non-GMO and the people around you kinda see you making weird expressions and moving your head all around but don't really care that much cause they're more interested in their Instagram feed.   Peanut Butter
We're simple folk and it doesn't get much simpler than our Peanut Butter Bites. Oh you want a peanut buttery inside with crunchy dry roasted peanut exterior? Check and check. We added some plant protein to let you know this isn't just a huge gob of peanut butter and to make it more ""snack-y"" and satisfying, which we've heard are nice things to have in a snack.

We think the invention of the chocolate + peanut butter flavor combination was perhaps more important than the invention of the wheel...or the light bulb. It's certainly the best tasting of those inventions. This high in plant-based protein, non-gmo, vegan bar will make you rethink the world as you know it, or at least look off in the distance and think about the first person that ever tried these flavors together and how it must have blown their mind.   Peanut Butter
We looked at peanut butter and said: ""let's make a bar out of this"" but peanut butter doesn't hold its shape very well.
